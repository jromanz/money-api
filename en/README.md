# Introduction

System of information that are developed works with monetary values. However it is funny to know that concern about money and  currency are just relegated to primitives types like Float, Double and BigDecimal.  System with a good design has own implementation of money and currency. But if many people has the same problem why does not solve it?

The JSR 354 (Money and Currency API) is a work to define an API and provides representation about the approach around the money and currency.
